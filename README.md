# Bloomberg Stream

Downloads and appends each 2 second Transport Stream video file from Bloomberg's server to a local file using HTTP requests.

Uses threading to concurrently play the video file in Windows Media Player in real time.

Enjoy live Bloomberg TV in a sleek window without any of the annoyances that come with using a web browser such as JavaScript nonsense like viewing-time limits, paywalls, ad-blocker blocking, ect...

Also, you obviously have a downloaded file that you can re-watch later. 

```
Closing Windows Media Player will kill __main__ and the transport stream thread as well
```
